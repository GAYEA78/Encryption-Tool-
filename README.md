Encryption Tool
The **Secret Message Machine** is an advanced Java software that showcases my skills in object-oriented programming, interface design, and algorithm development. This project provides users with a secure and interactive way to encrypt and decrypt messages using two classic encryption techniques: the Caesar Cipher and the Vigenère Cipher. 

The system is built with a modular and extensible architecture that demonstrates proficiency in designing reusable and maintainable code. The `Cipher` interface defines a standardized contract for encryption and decryption, promoting scalability by enabling the integration of additional ciphers in the future. The specific implementations of the `Caesar` and `Vigenère` ciphers highlight my ability to translate complex cryptographic algorithms into efficient and robust Java code.

The `SecretMessage` class serves as the entry point, incorporating my expertise in user-centered design by providing clear instructions, error handling, and an intuitive workflow. It demonstrates my ability to interact with end-users effectively through a command-line interface, handle inputs dynamically, and ensure smooth program execution even in edge cases.

Additionally, this project illustrates my knowledge of string manipulation, modular arithmetic, and pattern matching, as well as my attention to detail in ensuring secure handling of sensitive operations. By combining algorithmic thinking with practical application design, this project underscores my ability to tackle technical challenges and deliver solutions that are both functional and user-friendly. 

This project is a reflection of my technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and ability to build software that adheres to high standards of quality and functionality.
